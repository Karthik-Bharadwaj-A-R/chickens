    <h1>Chickens!</h1>
    <p>
        A chicken is a bird. One of the features 
        that differentiate it from most other 
        birds is that it has a comb and two wattles. 
        The comb is the red appendage on the top of 
        the head, and the wattles are the two 
        appendages under the chin. These are 
        secondary sexual characteristics and are 
        more prominent in the male.
